								<h2>Profile<br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Hey there, my name is Thomas Pham and I am 18 years old. I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia; however, both my parents are from Vietnam. During my spare time I often like to solve Rubik’s cubes, in fact the quickest time I have solved one is 15~ seconds. Furthermore, I love to play a variety of computer games such as League of legends, Valorant and Osu.
</p>I have also been teaching myself to learn the piano as a side hobby for the past two years. My main motivation to learn the piano was to be able to learn and play new songs, however now that I have learnt my favourite songs it has left my learning to a standstill :(. Hopefully, I can find another song that I enjoy so I can continue to become a better pianist.</p>

								<h2>Interests in Information Technology<br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Growing in the age where technology is rapidly changing our society, it has shown me that technology is one of the most important things to my life. In fact, every day I use some form of technology whether it be my cell phone or my personal computer. My interest only exacerbated when I bought my first computer and played games on it non-stop. I had also watched an anime called ‘Sword Art Online’, which therefore made me very intrigued with the concept of Full Dive VR. Although the technology probably will not be accessible in the foreseeable future, it is a very cool concept that piqued my interest. A few years ago, I was lucky enough to go to Melbourne University for a Hands-on Engineering program and was able to try out Virtual Reality for the first time. In my eyes, it is the most future proof area of study and the most interesting. My cousin has told me that IT is constantly changing and is such a broad area, therefore I will always be kept on my feet and will not become bored. </p>
							<p>There were many reasons that culminated to me to choose studying at RMIT university. My first reason is that my brother and cousin went to RMIT for their courses which gave me great insight on the quality of their teaching and structures of the courses. Secondly, my cousin who works in IT told me that RMIT was the best option for this area of study and finally the location of RMIT was the most convenient for me to travel to as it was relatively close to Melbourne station.
</p>
							<p>In this course I expect to learn many things in the IT area such as virtual reality/augmented reality, artificial intelligence and coding. I also expect to learn things such as data management, cloud computing and tools to help me find a job in the information technology sector. I hope that the study of this course will able me to find other areas of information technology that might interest me.</p>

									</h2>
								</header>
								<a href="https://www.oculus.com/careers/a1K2K000007r6kyUAA/"> Job advertisement from Oculus</a>
								<p>The position as an AR/VR Tools Engineer is to develop and build powerful tools and software to optimize VR. This job appeals to me because this area is still developing and therefore it would be fulfilling to be able to work on something so cutting edge. </p>
								<p>This job’s main role is to optimize and develop VR to be as efficient as possible, and to be able to do this I would need to have experience with an array of programming languages and hardware optimization. It would also be beneficial to have experience within the IT industry allowing me to widen my repertoire of skills.
</p>
								<p>Although I am nowhere near where I need to be to apply to for this job, I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Information Technology degree and from this degree I hope to get experience in Java, C and/or python. During the course’s group projects, I intend to try my best to find the best way to work in a team efficiently, learn to adapt to other people’s work styles and to be able to work within diverse workplaces. I will also try to apply for internships and gain more experience in this industry. Through this, I will hopefully have enough experience and knowledge to be able to apply for the position in Oculus.</p>

						<p>The tests above show some traits of what I am such as being a logical thinker and methodical. However, I do not think that this changes my behavior when I work in a team because I believe I am able to adapt to how other people work to make it easier for them. I believe that the results of the Myer-Briggs test could be beneficial when forming a team because having people who work in similar ways on a team could result in higher productivity.</p>

									<h2>The Project<br />
									</h2>
								</header>
                <h10> <strong>Overview</strong></h10>
								<p>An idea I had for the project was to make an augmented reality simulation app that specifically targets helping the medical industry and mental health. This app will have a wide range of instances that help future doctors do medical training such as simulating surgery and people with phobias and anxiety. This app could also help criminals who have been in prison for an extended amount of time and as a result have lost a sense of reality outside of the prison. It can do this virtually transporting them to (for example) a grocery store, and allow them to relearn shopping and interact with the cashier. </p>
                <h10><strong>Motivation</strong></h10>
								<p>Virtual reality and augmented reality is a very niche technology that has been mainly gaming focused. Although virtual reality is still a rapidly growing sector, I feel that it is still being underutilized by the general population with only 11% of adults in the US owning some sort of VR hardware according to a study by YouGov <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/news/61301/despite-gains-most-people-know-little-about-vr-or-would-use-it">(Source)</a>. Although only it is only 11%, it is still up from 7% in 2017. As more and more people buy virtual reality products, the readily downloadable simulation that can help people with phobias and anxiety will be a large benefit.</p>
                <h10><strong>Description</strong></h10>
								<p>This project’s main a role is to store many simulations of augmented reality that help a wide array of people. The general interface in mind was upon opening the app the user would be greeted with multiple tiles, these tiles will be students, phobias, mental health and more. Opening each tile will grant more simulations in that group. For example, if you were to open the phobia it would show multiple phobias such as claustrophobia, arachnophobia etc. Further opening a tile will allow you open simulations such spiders, a small room etc. Some examples of groups of people that it can help are:</p>
								<h12><strong>People with phobias</strong></h12>
								<p>The most successful way to treat a phobia is to use exposure therapy. As the name would suggest, this means to expose the target patient to the source of anxiety without the intention to cause harm. Augmented reality can be used to simulate the source of the patients fears. For example, if the patient were to have arachnophobia, the patient could be given an augmented reality headset to see a simulated spider move around. During this time the patient will be able to slowly work towards getting comfortable around spiders at their own pace. Another example would be aerophobia, augmented reality can simulate them being in the plane. It should be noted that since the patient will be using augmented reality headsets, they can easily take off their headset if they are feeling extremely unwell. This is a large benefit as it would be terrible if a patient with aerophobia were to be thrown in the deep end by putting them on a real plane.</p>
             <span class="image fit"><img src="images/spidervr.jpg" alt=""width="1280" height="600"> </span>
            <h12><strong>Prisoners</strong></h12>
						<p>Criminals who have been locked up for an extended amount of time (20+) years will inevitably lose the ability to function in society. The world is a lot different from 20 years ago and the difference only gets bigger the further back we go. To get these convicts ready for life out of prison, we could possibly have them experience the outside world through a virtual reality headset to get used to the feeling of society. Furthermore, the inmates can be transported virtually to a simulation of a grocery store. This can allow them to practice interactions with the cashier or teach them to use the self-checkout machine. Doing this could also be a source of hope for the inmate, giving them further reason to rehabilitate. </p>
            <span class="image fit"><img src="images/prisoners.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <h12><strong>Medical Students</strong></h12>
						<p>Medical students can make great use of this technology by being able to constantly practice things such as surgery on virtually simulated bodies, as a result this would eliminate the need to use cadavers. This simulation will work similarly to the game “surgery simulator”, in the game a body is simulated, and the aim is to perform on the virtual body. In a study by the Western Orthopaedic Association, medical students who trained with virtual reality completed surgery 20% faster and followed 38% steps more correctly than those how did not use it <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/08/16/virtual-reality-improve-surgeon-training/">(Source)</a>. With this technology we will be able to have a generation of more efficient people in the industry.</p>
						<span class="image fit"><img src="images/surgery.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<h10><strong>Tools and Technology</strong></h10>
						<p>In terms of tools and technology, the main pieces of hardware that will be needed is a virtual reality/ augmented reality headset and a decent computer to be able to render the 3D models efficiently. For the software, 3D modelling programs such as Autodesk 3ds max, blender and cinema 4D will be required to maximise the detail of the models. Other editing tools such as photo shop can be used to edit some photos and such. Developers and programmers should also be able to use applications such as WebVR and Unity/Unreal.  </p>
            <h10><strong>Skills required</strong></h10>
						<p>To be able to develop an app like this a large variety of skills would be needed such as: </p>
						<p> •	Knowledge in C# and JavaScript to be able to use UnityScript and WebVr and write efficient code </p>
						<p> •	UI/UX experience to produce an interface that is convenient and appealing for the end user </p>
						<p> •	3D Modelling skills to produce realistic and accurate models of things such as human body and spiders </p>
						<p>	•	Experts in many areas such as psychology, surgeons and entomologists would also be needed to oversee the virtual reality simulations to give feedback on what can be changed or done to make the most reliable and realistic end product as possible </p>
             <h10><strong>Outcome</strong></h10>
						 <p> If this project were to be a success, many people such as students, prison inmates and people with phobias/anxiety will be able to benefit from it. When virtual reality becomes more affordable and more easily accessible by the general population, everyone will have a quick and easy downloadable app that will help them with psychological issues and education. With depression and mental health being a growing problem, many people can seek out virtual reality to give them a sense of relief by virtually transporting them to pleasant scenarios such as a calm relaxing beach with ambient music playing. </p>
